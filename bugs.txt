bugs

- Make rabbitmq tasks use the rabbitmq_user module
- Replace all the passwords in playbooks with the variable names
- Currently the mysql user creation loop assumes all user's passwords will be the same
- All the openstack commands are currently set to ignore_errors because if the commands runs a 2nd time it errors on a duplicate entry and errors the entire playbook (this is going to require writing custom conditionals)
- For some reason the glance service create commands allowed dulicates so the endpoint create commands failed due to this
- Need to add to /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf :
[mariadb]
plugin_load_add = mysql_native_password
(lineinfile under the [mariadb] line, then restart mysql. This has to happen before keystone initialization) 
- Need to create the adminrc file in /root/
- Need to find a way to pull the environment variables from a single file in the tasks
